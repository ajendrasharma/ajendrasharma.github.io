        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            With over 5 years of applied experience in data science and machine learning, combined with 
            16 years in consulting, strategy, and operations, I bring a unique blend of technical and business acumen. 
            My journey spans domains like finance, healthcare, ISO certifications, HR, and smart cities, where I have developed 
            end-to-end machine learning models, implemented data-driven strategies, and led operational turnarounds.
            I specialize in AI product development, NLP, computer vision, and generative AI, with expertise in 
            frameworks like PyTorch, Hugging Face, and OpenAI.
